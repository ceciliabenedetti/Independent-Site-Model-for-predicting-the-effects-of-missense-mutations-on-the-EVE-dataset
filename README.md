# Independent Site Model for predicting the effects of missense mutations on the EVE dataset
A protein is an amino acids sequence that may be subject to mutations that are sometimes responsible for the onset of a disease. Assessing the propensity of these mutations to be pathogenic can have impactful implications for the future of healthcare and for clinical decisions. In light of these considerations, many supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict the effect of a human genetic variant. 
This work adopts the Independent Site Model (ISM) for the prediction of the pathogenicity of missense mutation and compares it with EVE, a Bayesian variational autoencoder algorithm used in a recent study to perform the same task. This is done with the primary objective of questioning whether the additional complexity of sophisticated models such as EVE has consistent beneficial effects in predicting the pathogenicity propensity of a missense mutation or if simple statistical models – such as the ISM – can reach equivalent results. 
The analysis shows that the Independent Site Model is an acceptable substitute for EVE in forecasting the pathogenicity score of a mutation. In addition, by averaging the prediction of the two models, a new predictor is created. This model outperforms EVE, ISM, and all the other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the area under the curve (AUC).
